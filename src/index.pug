    h1 Actor Based Ecosystems Simulation Software

    p Lets you develop simulations of systems consisting of multiple independent actors that interact with each other using a #[a(href="https://elm-lang.org/") delightful functional programing language Elm].


    h2 Sweet demos

    ul
      li
        h3: a.demo(href="?demo=Spreading") Spreading and Breeding Demo

        p The one created in the tutorial (#[a(href="https://gitlab.com/tad-lispy/ecosystem-simulation/#installation") see the README]).

        p [#[a(href="https://gitlab.com/tad-lispy/ecosystem-simulation/blob/master/src/Demos/Spreading.elm") source code]]
      
      li
        h3: a.demo(href="?demo=Binary") Binary Demo

        p [#[a(href="https://gitlab.com/tad-lispy/ecosystem-simulation/blob/master/src/Demos/Binary.elm") source code]]

        p A silly particle simulation. There are two variants of particles: #[code Uglon] and #[code Pretton]. Every particle is attracted to a #[code Pretton]. Every particle is repulsed by an #[code Uglon]. There is also a #[em strong force] that acts on short distances and repulses all particles from each other (so they don't get too cosy).

        h3 #[a.demo(href="?demo=Zombies") Zombies] üßü‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

        p [#[a(href="https://gitlab.com/tad-lispy/ecosystem-simulation/blob/master/src/Demos/Zombies.elm") source code]]

        p Zombies epidemic! Again there are two variants of actors: the #[code Living] and the #[code Dead]. The dead chase the living - the living run for their lives üò±üôÄ. They also flock together to find safety in numbers - the fools! When a living is bitten by a zombie - they get infected. Note that zombies move with the same speed as the living - neither can outrun the other. So if you stay far from danger, you should be safe... or should you? Do you think anyone will survive this? Watch and see for your self!


    h2 Get started

    p Please #[a(href="https://gitlab.com/tad-lispy/ecosystem-simulation/#installation") see the README] for instructions on how to get started.

    p Coming soon to the Elm packages repository near you.
